# TecanSafireTool

This jupyter notebook was originally created for personal use to quickly create plots of UV-Vis spectra originating from a Tecan Safire II spectrophotometer.

The workbook extracts metadata and optical absorbance spectra from Excel sheets (Microsoft Excel 97-2003) generated from the Tecan Safire II in a specific format.

## Features
1. Detects wavelength range
2. Accurately identifies number of measurement cycles (even when data is incomplete)
3. Plots UV-Vis spectra of a specific well in a well plate over time
4. Plots absorbance at a single wavelength over time
5. Plots temperature profile
6. Plots data from multiple well locations

## Notes
This project was kind of a one off to make my life easier during my masters degree so I will not be actively contributing this project. 
My hope is that this notebook serves as a good starting point for someone else.
